# adif-benchmark

A test suite to gauge performance of various golang ADIF parsers.

The HamRadioLog.Net parser is 2x - 3x faster than the nearest competitor.
It performs many fewer allocations and uses much less memory as well.

The JSON benchmark compares the golang standard library performance converting to/from a map[string]string of ADIF data.
It is present to provide a baseline for what acceptable performance may look like.

The test data was generated by running:
`./docker-bench.sh >>README.md`

Finally, the results were sorted from fastest to slowest.
